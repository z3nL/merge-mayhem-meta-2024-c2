While most HTML elements require both the opening and closing tag, there are a few elements that do not require a closing tag and they are called void elements and use self-closing tags. These elements have no content, like the `br` element which represents a line break. Check out [W3’s documentation on void elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/syntax.html#writing-html-documents-elements) to learn more.
