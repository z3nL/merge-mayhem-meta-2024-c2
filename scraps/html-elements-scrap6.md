In order for our style sheet, or CSS file, to identify the different `div` sections, we use custom selectors. This is where attributes like `id` and `class` come in!

- `id` attribute: An id is a name that is  unique to an element. This means that no two elements can share the same `id`.
- `class` attribute: Unlike the `id` attribute, multiple elements can share the same `class` name. This can be helpful when styling similar types of sections or elements.

We will explore more about the CSS syntax used to apply styling to `id` and `class` names in the next section. For now, let’s set up the structure of our client’s personal website based on our wireframe.
