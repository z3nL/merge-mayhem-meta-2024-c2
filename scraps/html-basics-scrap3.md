## HTML Boilerplate

**The HTML file is the most important file when building a basic website.** Some online IDEs like [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) or [Replit](https://replit.com/), you may notice that a basic website project comes pre-loaded with at least 3 files with the names `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. These are typical generic names an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file, but you can name your files any name you want. It is always best practice to give your files a short descriptive name so that it is easier for others to view your code.

All websites **must have at least one HTML file**, but CSS style and JavaScript script files are **optional**. To learn more about file naming conventions and organization tips, check out [MDN web docs on dealing with files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files).

*Note:* Web servers will often default to loading the `index.html` file if multiple HTML files are present, unless otherwise specified.
