## What is HTML?

**HTML** stands for **H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage. HTML is used to build the skeleton of the website including which elements (text, images, buttons, etc.) should be included and the order in which they appear. Web browsers like Chrome or Safari know how to interpret HTML files and render their contents as an interactive web page.
